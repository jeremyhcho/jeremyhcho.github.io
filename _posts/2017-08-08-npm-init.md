I wanted to create a Node/Express project that proxies `/api/**` routes to my Phoenix app
running on `http://localhost:4000` with HMR. Using [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) alongside [webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) seemed to be the answer for most, but what seems to be the norm for every developer - it wasn't working for me. However, here's what did work for me:

1. Set up a proxy server with [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy).
2. Configure `devServer` in `webpack.config.js` to use a proxy.
3. Run `node` alongside `webpack-dev-server` in one command.

### Proxying Requests to the API
I needed to tell Express to proxy all incoming `/api` routes to `http://localhost:4000`
which is the default port that Phoenix runs on.


{% highlight js %}
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const httpProxy = require('http-proxy')
const proxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer()

app.all('/api/*', (req, res) => {
  proxy.web(req, res, {
    target: 'http://localhost:4000'
  })
})
{% endhighlight %}

That sets up my Express proxy up, but my dev server runs on port 8080 (by default)
which is different from the port that I had set up my Express server on. I needed to
tell my dev server to proxy any incoming requests to my Express server.

## Configure `devServer` in `webpack.config.js`
In order to accomplish that, I configured the `devServer` option inside my Webpack configs.

```
devServer: {
  hot: true,
  historyApiFallback: true,
  inline: true,
  contentBase: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  publicPath: '/',
  filename: 'bundle.js',
  proxy: {
    '*': 'http://localhost:3000'
  },
  stats: {
    colors: true
  }
}
```

The important part about this is the `proxy` key. This configuration tells my dev server
to proxy every request to Express which is running on port 3000.

## Running the Script
In order to run both servers in one script, I created a couple scripts in my `package.json`.

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "node ./server.js | npm run dev-server",
  "dev-server": "webpack-dev-server --content-base=www --inline --hot"
}
```

Now all you have to do is run `$ npm run start` to boot up your app.


## After Thoughts
Setting up a Node project is always annoying.. Maybe I should use this as my
boilerplate.
